Learning Core Audio Examples
----

These are the examples with the Learning Core Audio Examples, I made a fork to
update some of the references so the projects build on OSX 10.10. 

Updating references is easy, select a project go to Build Phases and expand the
Link Binary With Libraries section. Remove the references to frameworks that are
not found and add them back by clicking + and locating the framework that the
project requires.
